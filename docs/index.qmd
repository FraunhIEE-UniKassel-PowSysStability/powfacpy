# Introduction
*powfacpy* is a wrapper around the Python API of PowerFactory&copy; (software for power system simulation by *DIgSILENT*). You can automate almost anything in PowerFactory&copy; with the native API, but the syntax can be verbose. Therefore, powfacpy provides features and interface classes to make your life easier.

For example, setting attributes of an object in the PowerFactory&copy; database requires several lines of code with the native API. With the API of powfacpy, this is only one line:

```python
set_attr(r"Network Model\Network Data\Grid\Terminal MV",{"uknom":33,"outserv":0})
```
Here we have set two attributes (`uknom`, `outserv`) of the object specified under the path `Network Mod…`.

Plotting also requires many lines with the native API (need to add the variable to the monitored variables, create a plot page, add the curve,..). Using *powfacpy* the syntax is succinct and similar to matplotlib. Just activate a plot and then plot variables of an object:

```python
set_active_plot("Active power","§ PV plant")
plot(r"Network Model\Network Data\Grid\PV", "m:Psum:bus1")
```

*powfacpy* will save you time and make your code more readable. Get started with the [Tutorials](tutorials/overview.qmd).

Contributions (new features, bug reports, feature requests, etc.) are very welcome on Github.
