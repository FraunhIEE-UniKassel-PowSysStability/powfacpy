## v0.3.0
- Structural changes: 
  - In this version, the structure of *powfacpy* has changed fundamentally
  - Please have a look at [Structure of *powfacpy*](../docs/structure_of_powfacpy.qmd) to understand the new structure and why the restructuring was necessary
  - Instead of PFBaseInterface the class `ActiveProject` from *base/active_project* should be used
  - Interfaces for plotting, case study, etc. are now found under *applications/*.
  - All former interface classes can still be used, but their files are located in a folder called *deprecated* and you will get  deprecation warnings
- There should be few breaking changes. Some of the known are:
  - The labels of the result export to pandas have changed (see the [tutorial](../tutorials/simulation_and_plotting.qmd))
  - The name of the method `export_results_of_study_cases` of the class `PFStudyCases` has changed to `export_results_of_study_cases_to_csv`
- *black* formatter was introduced as the standard formatter for python code
- The format of the website was changed from *sphinx* to *quarto*
- Functionality:
  - Interface for network topology was added
  - Interfaces to several single *PowerFactory* classes was added (see [*powfacpy/pf_classes/*](../../src/powfacpy/pf_classes/))
