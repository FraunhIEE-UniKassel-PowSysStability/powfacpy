Getting started
---------------------------
Start here with the 
`getting started tutorial <https://github.com/FraunhIEE-UniKassel-PowSysStability/powfacpy/blob/main/tutorials/getting_started.ipynb>`_.
This tutorial gives an overview of the interaction with the *PowerFactory* 
database using *powfacpy*. The methods introduced in this tutorial serve as a basis to 
do more complex things and to write more readable code using less lines of code.

Dynamic Simulation and Plotting

Study Cases
-----------------------
The `study cases tutorial <https://github.com/FraunhIEE-UniKassel-PowSysStability/powfacpy/blob/main/tutorials/study_cases.ipynb>` 
provides a flexible method for automatically creating study cases with different data.
